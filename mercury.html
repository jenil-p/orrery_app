                    Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to
                    the
                    Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at
                    night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
