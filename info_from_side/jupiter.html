                    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with
                    a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the
                    Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects in the Earth's night sky and has been
                    known to ancient civilizations. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. <br>
                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of other gases. It has a
                    thick atmosphere and a prominent red spot, which is a large storm system. Jupiter has 79 known
                    moons, with the four largest being Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are known for
                    their volcanic activity, icy surfaces, and the possibility of liquid water beneath their icy crusts.
                    <br>
                    Jupiter is a unique and fascinating object in our solar system, and its many moons and storms
                    continue to be studied by scientists to understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar
                    system.

                            It is a large, infrared-sensitive telescope launched by NASA in 2021. The JWST is designed
                            to observe distant galaxies, black holes, and other celestial objects in the early universe. <br>
                            It has a 21.3-foot (6.5-meter) primary mirror and is designed to operate in space to avoid
                            atmospheric interference. The JWST has already made groundbreaking discoveries, such as the
                            detection of water vapor on the atmospheres of exoplanets and the formation of the first
                            galaxies. <br> It continues to be used for scientific research and has opened up new avenues for
                            understanding the origins and evolution of the universe. <br>

                            NASA in 1989 to study Jupiter and its moons. It was the first mission to directly observe
                            the volcanic activity on Io, one of Jupiter's largest moons. <br> Galileo also studied the
                            magnetic field of Jupiter and its moons, as well as the composition of the planet's
                            atmosphere. <br> The mission was a success and provided valuable data on Jupiter's atmosphere,
                            magnetic field, and moons. Galileo was decommissioned in 2003, but its data continues to be
                            used for scientific research. <br>

                    Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system, with more than 400
                    active volcanoes. <br>
                    Io is the closest moon to Jupiter and is the innermost and largest of the Galilean moons. <br> It is a
                    rocky, heavily cratered world with a thin atmosphere. <br> Io is unique among the moons in the solar
                    system because it has the highest volcanic activity, with more than 400 active volcanoes. <br> These
                    volcanoes are some of the most powerful in the solar system, spewing lava and ash into space. <br> Io's
                    volcanic activity is caused by tidal forces from Jupiter, which stretch and compress the moon's
                    interior, generating heat and causing the volcanoes to erupt. <br> The volcanoes on Io are some of the
                    most active in the solar system and are a major source of material that forms the Jovian system's
                    rings. <br>
