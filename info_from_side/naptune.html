                    Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and is known for its deep blue color, which is caused by methane in its atmosphere. It is a gas giant with a diameter of about 30,600 miles (49,200 kilometers) and is famous for its strong winds, which can exceed 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most significant.

                    Triton is Neptune's largest moon and is unique for its retrograde orbit, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity. It is one of the few geologically active moons in the solar system, featuring geysers that spew nitrogen gas into space. Triton has a thin atmosphere and a surface covered in frozen nitrogen and methane.
