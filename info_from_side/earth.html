                    Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. It's
                    also the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. <br>
                    Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, just slightly larger than nearby Venus.
                    <br>
                    NASA has the most missions of all operating on our home planet. <br> <br>

                    Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot. <br>
                    The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by
                    moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also
                    causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. <br>
                    Our moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting planets in our solar system. <br> <br>

Building on the successes of its predecessors, Chandrayaan-3 aims to achieve a soft landing on the Moon's surface, specifically in the southern polar region. The mission includes a lander named Vikram and a rover called Pragyan, designed to conduct scientific experiments and explore the lunar terrain. On August 23, 2023, Vikram successfully landed on the Moon, making India the first country to reach the lunar south pole, a region of significant interest due to its potential water ice deposits and unique geological features. <br>

On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin landed the lunar module, Eagle, on the Sea of Tranquility, while Collins orbited above in the command module, Columbia. Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface, famously declaring, “That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” The astronauts spent about 21 hours on the lunar surface, conducting experiments, collecting samples, and taking photographs before returning to Earth. Apollo 11 safely landed back on Earth on July 24, 1969, marking a significant achievement in space exploration and a major milestone in the Space Race. <br>
