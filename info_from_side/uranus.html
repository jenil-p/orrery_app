                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its striking blue color, resulting from the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It is an ice giant with a diameter of about 31,500 miles (50,700 kilometers). Uranus has a unique tilt of 98 degrees, causing it to roll along its orbit. The planet has 27 known moons, with Miranda being one of the most interesting due to its diverse geological features.

                    Miranda is one of Uranus's moons and is known for its varied and complex surface, which includes large canyons, terraces, and impact craters. It has a diameter of about 235.8 kilometers (146.5 miles). The moon's unusual features suggest a history of geological activity and possible past collisions.
