                    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its
                    reddish appearance, which is a result of iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is about half the size
                    of Earth and has a thin atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Mars features the largest
                    volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest.
                    Additionally, it has a large canyon system known as Valles Marineris, which is over 2,500 miles
                    (4,000 kilometers) long.
                    <br>
                    Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids. The planet
                    has polar ice caps made of water and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) that change with the seasons.
                    Mars has been a major target for exploration, with various missions sending rovers and landers to
                    study its geology, climate, and potential for past life.

                            on Mars in February 2021 as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. Its main goal is to search for
                            signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for potential return to Earth.
                            Perseverance also carries the Ingenuity helicopter, which has performed the first powered
                            flights on another planet, testing new technologies for future aerial exploration. <br>

                    Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars' two moons and is one of the smallest moons in the solar
                    system. It orbits Mars at an extremely close distance, completing a full orbit in just 7 hours and
                    39 minutes, making it one of the few moons that rises in the west and sets in the east. Phobos is
                    heavily cratered and has a very irregular shape, resembling a lumpy potato. <br>
                    Its surface is covered in dust and loose rocks, and it has a large groove system, which is thought
                    to be caused by tidal forces from Mars. Phobos is slowly spiraling inward and is predicted to either
                    crash into Mars or break apart, forming a ring system in the next 50 million years. <br>
