                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth’s "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. However, its surface is extremely hot, with average temperatures reaching around 900°F (475°C) due to a thick atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, which creates a runaway greenhouse effect. 
                    <br>
                    Venus has a rocky surface with mountains, valleys, and thousands of volcanoes. It rotates very slowly on its axis, with a day longer than its year. Despite being the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus's thick clouds of sulfuric acid obscure its surface.
