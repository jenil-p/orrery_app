                    Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system. It is a terrestrial planet with a rocky surface and has no atmosphere to speak of, resulting in extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night. Mercury's surface is heavily cratered, resembling the Moon. 
                    <br>
                    It has a very weak magnetic field and is composed mainly of iron. One of Mercury's most notable features is its large core, which accounts for a significant portion of its mass. Despite being close to the Sun, Mercury has been visited by only one spacecraft, Mariner 10, in the 1970s.
