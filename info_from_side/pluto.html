                    Pluto, once considered the ninth planet of the solar system, is now classified as a dwarf planet. It has a diameter of about 1,430 miles (2,302 kilometers) and is primarily composed of ice and rock. Pluto has a thin atmosphere that expands as it gets closer to the Sun. It has five known moons, with Charon being the largest, sharing a unique relationship with Pluto.

                    Charon is Pluto's largest moon, and it is almost half the size of Pluto itself, leading to a unique binary system. The two bodies are tidally locked, meaning the same side of Charon always faces Pluto. Charon has a dark polar cap and is believed to have a young surface, indicating possible geological activity.
