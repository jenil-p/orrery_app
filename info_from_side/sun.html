                    The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, and it is the most important source of energy
                    for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to temperatures of millions
                    of degrees at its core. <br>
                    The Sun accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system and provides the
                    gravitational pull that keeps the planets in orbit. <br>
                    Its energy output, which is essential for life, powers weather patterns and ocean currents on Earth.

                            between ESA and NASA, launched in 1995. It has provided a continuous view of the Sun,
                            studying its internal structure, atmosphere, and solar wind. SOHO has greatly enhanced our
                            understanding of solar activity and its impact on the solar system.</p>

                            is designed to observe the Sun's outermost layers (the photosphere and chromosphere) and the
                            solar corona. Aditya-L1 will help scientists better understand solar activities and their
                            impact on space weather, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections that can affect
                            satellites and power grids on Earth.</p>
